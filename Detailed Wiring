**NOTE**: That Resistors Are Not Required**** (line 30) as an example.



Components Needed:
Arduino Uno or any compatible board
16x2 LCD Display 
DS1307 RTC Module
Passive Buzzer
5 Push Buttons
10kΩ potentiometer
Breadboard and jumper wires
Resistors (220Ω for the LCD backlight, 10kΩ for each button)
Wiring Instructions:

1. Connecting the 16x2 LCD Display:

LCD Pin  |  Arduino Pin
-----------------------
VSS      |  GND
VDD      |  5V
V0       |  Potentiometer middle pin
RS       |  7
RW       |  GND
E        |  8
D4       |  9
D5       |  10
D6       |  11
D7       |  12
A        |  5V (through 220Ω resistor) <- optional.****
K        |  GND



2. Connecting the DS1307 RTC Module:
VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.
SDA: Connect to the A4 pin on the Arduino (shared with the LCD).
SCL: Connect to the A5 pin on the Arduino (shared with the LCD).

3. Connecting the Passive Buzzer:
Positive pin: Connect to pin 13 on the Arduino.
Negative pin: Connect to GND on the Arduino.

4. Connecting the Buttons:
Each button will have two legs. One leg will be connected to the Arduino, and the other leg will be connected to GND through a 10kΩ resistor (pull-down resistor).

*Snooze Button:
One leg to pin 2 on the Arduino.
Other leg to GND through a 10kΩ resistor.
Same leg to 5V (without resistor).

*Set Hour Button:
One leg to pin 3 on the Arduino.
Other leg to GND through a 10kΩ resistor.
Same leg to 5V (without resistor).

*Set Minute Button:
One leg to pin 4 on the Arduino.
Other leg to GND through a 10kΩ resistor.
Same leg to 5V (without resistor).

*Increase Button:
One leg to pin 5 on the Arduino.
Other leg to GND through a 10kΩ resistor.
Same leg to 5V (without resistor).

*Decrease Button:
One leg to pin 6 on the Arduino.
Other leg to GND through a 10kΩ resistor.
Same leg to 5V (without resistor).

5. Connecting the Potentiometer:
Middle Pin: Connect to the V0 pin of the LCD.
One Outer Pin: Connect to 5V.
Other Outer Pin: Connect to GND.
^^^ (Doesnt matter which outer pins connect to GND or 5V)
